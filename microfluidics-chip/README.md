# Microfluidics Chip

This directory contains the design file for the microfluidics chip.

## Contents

- `microfluidics-chip.dxf`: A DXF (Drawing Exchange Format) file containing the 2D design of the microfluidics chip. This file can be used for fabrication, typically with methods like laser cutting or photolithography.

## Description

This project is part of the ZJU-China 2025 iGEM team's hardware. The microfluidics chip is designed for precise handling of small fluid volumes in our experiments.
